# NLP Driven Artist Fan Sentiment Analysis

Project Description:

• Created an end-to-end NLP - machine learning pipeline to analyze artist-fan sentiment on social media to help unsigned musicians understand their audience better.

• Scraped over 195k social media comments for 6 target music artists and pre-processed data for modeling. 

• Developed LSTM and RoBERTa models, optimizing RoBERTa using contextual embedding to improve accuracy by 5% to 78%. 

• Performed K-Means clustering to categorize artists' fanbases and quantify distribution across super, engaged and ambient fans types. 

• Used BerTopic for topic modeling to automatically discover relationships in artists' content.

• Built interactive visualizations to monitor sentiment changes over time across platforms.

• Presented sentiment analysis results and visualizations to stakeholders.

• Recommended artists tailor content types and topics to specific fan types based on sentiment analysis and fan categorization.

• This enabled data-driven recommendations on how artists can better resonate with fans through tailored content.
