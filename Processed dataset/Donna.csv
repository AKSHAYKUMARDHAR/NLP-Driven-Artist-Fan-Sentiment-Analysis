You have an amazing voice. I lost my dog and believe it or not that’s why I’m jealous of the Angels.

I was there and held him when he went to see them. I choose to let him go so he would not suffer. Unselfish Love but I knew you’d be going where the Angels are....

One day when I get there god is going to be like you’ve got more dogs waiting on you then people.

This is one of the main doctrines of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (aka) Mormons. They believe that we are all sons and daughters of a Heavenly Father and Mother and dwelt with them before coming to earth. Many find this a beautiful doctrine and are starting to embrace it!

1360446822.0,Kimberly Cep,When my mother died in January I found this song on YouTube and listened to it on my flight home for her funeral. It truly touched my soul. In my private last moments with my mother I told her what an amazing inspiration she has been in my life and how much Im going to miss her. I guess I listened to this song so much my phone saved it and it began to play as I was holding her hand one last time. When I hear this song it reminds me of everything good that was my mom and how jealous I truly am that I can't have her in my here and now. Ive shared this with friends who have lost loved ones and it helps us all grieve in a sweet loving way. Just wanted to say thank you so much for helping me through losing half my soul.,2018-10-10 02:20,neutral,sadness

100000946493290.0,Brian McTaggart,"Good for you Donna, having time with your family is special and so many regret later in life that they didn’t do what is what I think the best time of our children’s younger years.  To watch them grow from a baby to pre - school is one of the funniest and sometimes painful part of our connection with them as a parent.  They are so comical and can cheer us up when we have had little sleep, they cheer us up with their antics and sometimes comments but they can also cause us pain when they are going through pain themselves.  When they are ill we worry so much it does cause us pain because we don’t get the answers or treatment from the medical people.  We want more from them, but that’s part of us being a parent and wanting our children to be treated as special, as they all are and that’s why spending time with them in their pre - school years is a fantastic experience for us and our children.  I could go on and on lol but I won’t.  Just enjoy every minute you have with your family and then come back and give adults some of your time.  Your voice and songs bring so much to people around the world.  God Bless lovely lady 💜💜xx💜💜",2019-03-29 10:46,positive,joy

When you are old and can no longer perform it will be your children who will hold your hand and be thankful for the beautiful mother they have. You will need to hear their stories from when they were little about what they did you with you and their daddy, not about all the travelling you did to sing. In saying all that?? Your music brings me peace in my grief. Your music makes my heart sing. I have no idea where to buy it so I have to listen on YouTube. I live in rural Australia.. I mean this. Take it Easy beautiful lady - take it easy ..your fan for life",2019-03-29 22:44,positive,admiration

As I sang every word along with you, tears rolling down my face, I thought of how proud my Mum would have been of my song choice. Really looking forward to seeing you live in the future.

1371632699.0,Rodney Denney,Good Going Donna. Their writing style is different and a lot of the songs here in the US have repeating chorus lines. If you could adapt that style to some of the songs your message would be easier for us here who are use to that style. Keep on learning and working your craft . You still have momentum from JOA tours and your following is still growing. Keep the intimate arenas and venues for a bit longer. This will add to the number of shows but will still grow your audience.  Stay safe and enjoy your time here in the States.  Oh did you get you some S.O.S over some Hash Browns ? lol. Great for breakfast.,2019-09-15 23:01,positive,caring

Many law enforcement family’s can relate to this song. Many officers have sacrificed there lives to help others. My son went to Heaven November 14 2017. He was helping another doctor that was out from surgery. On my son’s way home he went to be an angel with God. Your song is played many time, reminding us all of him.

1060494959.0,Marlene Heerwig Lynch,"My father passed away on December 14th 2018, his one year anniversary is around the corner.  He suffered a massive stroke on Dec 10th and we made the difficult decision to let him pass with dignity knowing there wasn't anything we could do to bring him back.   We chose this song to be played at his celebration of life on December 17th.   It was so very appropriate.  As the one year anniversary approaches, I see the loneliness left behind in my mother.  They were married 62 years.  My father was a saint for all he endured in his years of marriage, we all told him his pedestal in heaven we will only be able to touch his toes when we arrive. :)  But the loneliness my mother now goes through is even more heartbreaking.   You have the voice of an angel and I thank you for this very beautiful song.  It truly was a beautiful touch to his going away.  <3",2019-11-19 00:18,positive,sadness

Ur record Jealous of the Angels was one of the first songs i heard after burying my husband  of 40 years married but together for 45 that was 4 years ago after hearing ur song i had to go and buy the CD which i play all the time along with another of ur albums that a friend bought me. Twice now I’ve been going to see u in concert and both times i was ill so I’m hoping next time ur at a venue nearby it will be 3rd time lucky and i will actually be well enough to come and see u. Ur music is so beautiful it has also helped me get through mental health issues after having a breakdown through the grief of losing my wonderful husband so u can probably understand why it means so much to me to actually be able to come and see u in person. 
Hope u enjoy the rest of the holidays with ur beautiful family and i look forward to hearing more music from the voice of an angel which b is what u r to me. Sending u all loads of love and hugs xxxxxxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxx xxxxxxxxxxxxx",2019-12-26 21:55,positive,optimism

My wife passed away at 53  from COVID 19 on April 19 and Jealous of the Angels hit me so hard because it was exactly how I was feeling when the hospital called me to tell me she was declining rapidly and wouldn’t make it through the night, yet I couldn’t be by her side holding her hand.  She died with the nurses by her side. My wife’s friend actually sent me this song and I haven’t stopped listening to it since. I played it at the cemetery when we laid her to rest. I listen to it 2 times a day, once in the morning while I drive to work and once when I climb in to my bed staring at her empty side of the bed. Thank you for signing that beautiful song.",2020-07-29 23:35,positive,admiration

Our friend Lisa passed away, and though I am more of a fb friend as of late, she meant something in my heart, as a woman and a friend, from minute one. We all adored her and she was a beauty! Cancer won in her battle, but she fought that beast! This song was perfect....

I posted this knowing yesterday was Overdose Awareness Day and that too many friends lost their children to this during Covid19, some feeling this world was just too much. Wishing they knew....

I am celebrating a surgery 4 years ago today that had me gone for a bit, unable to be revived, and yet they got me back, there has been a lot through these 4 years since that surgery. 

My Lifer-Bestie lost her husband, and my family my Uncle the day before, 3 years ago, and this song may be nice for when she or my Aunt sit quietly alone with their memories! 

All of these reason, when this song hit my ears moments ago, I knew I had to share it... YOU, my dear, were delightfully touched by God's hands with a voice that works the soul... thank you for letting us hear it and pass it on, and to look into supporting you as we inquire... Amen!!!

This is the first American Thanksgiving without him at the table. I'm originally from Liverpool England. But I live in Dallas Texas, I came here when I was 19 to marry my prince in Boston. We had 3 sons, now two living, thank you for your song and beautiful words. I miss myteo elder sisters in Waterloo, Liverpool so much.  I'm a military Widow and a grandmother and great-grandmother here in the states. And with this virus going around everywhere. I couldn't fly home to be with family when I needed them so much after losing my son, I sure needed that hugs. It is still so surreal the pain of loss never really goes away, but your singing and you're beautiful words of your song helped me very much, this USA Thanksgiving Day. God bless you my dear and when I come to Ireland I'll come and visit you for a cuppa!!! When  I do come home I fly into Manchester Rent-A-Car, go to Liverpool see my sisters, and then we go on the Seakat over to Ireland, it is so beautiful there. Can you send me your website back so that I can share it with all my friends in America on my family in England I know they love it and they can buy your recording.  I'm sending you a big Texas sized hug love to all your precious family. God bless,  Shirley ❤😁🌷🦋",2020-11-29 12:43,neutral,gratitude

I'm from Durban South Africa.. I was doing a video for a dear Pastor friend who passed away at the age of 84 years... I used your song and something special and supernatural happened.... I could not stop the tears flowing and felt such an annointing.. As I was doing the final edit... The message the theme, the tribute and the closure all came together.... With the song....

My ex was admitted to a ward and was given a tablet by the nurse and was treated hideously cold by the nursing staff on this ward, not one nice word was said to us.

For almost five years now my mom has been gone I was her caregiver. We never saw eye to eye for 20 some odd years it was that hate/love kind of relationship between my mom and I  but she never stopped loving me  when she was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer (October 10th 2016) my life came crumbling down I spent every waking moment with her taking care of her I finally had the courage to apologize to her for hating her for so long in the shortest time she was with us we got closer than we ever were when the day she passed away I got a phone call you know that bad gut feeling that something was wrong well I had it when I answered the call getting ready to go get my son from the bus stop  the woman who called me asked if she was talking to me  when I said she was she went quiet for a few minutes and said I'm so sorry I wish this was easy to tell you  I wish there was a way to express  how truly sorry I am but your mom just passed away a few minutes ago (November 29th 2016) I  died twice that day  losing my mom  and when I told my son that his grandma was gone he broke down crying and all I could do was hold him in the middle of the driveway knowing I couldn't take his pain away. From 2015 to 2017 I lost 8 family members 

All I'm going to say is if you hate your mom or dad  or even both  let go of that hatred  cause you don't know when its their time to go   you don't know the pain and suffering that you will go through when they are gone  I learned the hard way  even though my mom accepted my apology I hate myself more for not forgiving her sooner  ",2021-08-08 11:17,positive,sadness

Thought I would let you know I've often sent your Angel song to friends who lost a human or Rhodesian Ridgeback pup-and that, most often.

 I was made aware today from someone in my RR dog group that her college friend wrote this song- imagine my surprise and delight!  Your rendition is my favorite-  a bit has to do with my grandparents Ireland's scenery. Lovely!

Thank you for this bittersweet song that has made a difference in mourning of my 500+RR member group ...that includes me, as,I too lost my sweet boy...

Thank you. I can assure you God did need another Angel at his throne!👏💞❤️",2021-09-25 04:41,positive,gratitude

544170915.0,Shannon Kasper Smith,"What a beautiful song, sung by a beautiful woman with an angel's voice.  So heartfelt, really tugs at the heart strings.  I lost both my mom and dad without notice, neither one of them had been sick, not that we were aware of, and both died without any warning.  My Dad has been gone 20 years (on September 27th, Monday), heart attack at 69 while at home by himself, died instantly.  My Mom passed just last year, on May 4th which threw us all for a loop.  We hadn't seen my mom since February 16th do to covid and all the lockdowns/health restrictions that were being enforced and she was in a Personal Care Home which was on lockdown.  The last time we seen her on February 16th, she was in good spirits, was enjoying being with her great grandchildren and watching them play around.  I was even discussing with one of them about having Great Grandma's 85th birthday Party celebration (next year, which is this year, October 23rd), and the room we were going to have it in at the home.  My mom and I would talk on the phone while we weren't able to see each other, but it sure isn't the same, especially for the eldery who are on their own or in PC Homes, and have alzheimers/dementia.  I feel that if I was able to see my Mom, even within a day or a few of her passing that she would still be here with us now.  Apparently she was septic when she arrived at the hospital, she was in a septic coma!  That doesn't happen in the shake of a finger!  Had I been able to see her, I know that I would have sensed something wasn't right with her, as I had in the past, and most likely the doctor could have caught what it was before she went septic!  My mom was my best friend, confident, she was my everything and I miss her with my entire being!  Love you Momma, this song is going out to you from me, until we are together again  <3",2021-09-25 08:06,positive,sadness

100004994221312.0,Teva Schillig,So happy for you Donna Taggart ! My 12 year old daughter and I can't wait to hopefully see you in Nashville one day in the future! Your beautiful voice singing Jealous Of The Angels was our number 1 pick at my grandfather's funeral in 2017. We watched him slowly and painfully decline from cancer pretty quickly over a few months. You are the only one my daughter has listened to all the years all the time. Your the only one she would love to see in concert. She's never been to a concert. Sending love and good vibes your way from our little town Chapel Hill in Tennessee!!!! 🎤🎵🎤 ,2021-11-02 11:59,positive,love

Now since I'm a very emotionally charged person, it wasn't long before I felt a few tears welling up inside of me. The lyrics, music, and your angelic voice were perfect musical chemistry for the message of this song. since I've lost both my mom and Dad, I'm also a bit jealous of the angels. Any chance you will get to perform in the New Jersey/New York area anytime soon? God bless you and yours and I pray you all have a wonderful Christmas holiday.",2021-12-07 00:55,positive,admiration

Jealous of the Angels put into words how I was feeling after losing him.  I cry every time I hear it, but it also brings me peace, to know he’s with the angels!  He was my hero, in so many ways.  I miss him every minute of every day.  Thank you for this beautiful song, that’s helped me through the worst time in my life! 💔💔",2022-07-30 04:28,positive,sadness
