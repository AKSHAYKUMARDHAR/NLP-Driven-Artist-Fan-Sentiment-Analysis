With 3 weeks to go, can't you be refunded for the ferry & Hotel,
If not, I wonder if you can ""salvage"" by playing live in the town near to where you would be staying? 
I thought we were emerging out the years of uncertainty. 
Seems either events are ""sold out"" in a micro-second or no one is interested? Even a major singer like Bryan Adams had to cancel a tour here 😒",2022-06-25 09:59,positive,remorse
1221648650.0,Tony Mendes,The issue with a country music festival is that you need major American country artists performing to attract the most British country fans. Sadly most British Country fans are not interested in British Country artists. Money is not the issue as when I was in Stratford yesterday there were thousands of people heading to West Ham United football ground to see Green Day. There are also big crowds at Glastonbury. I was at Black Deer Festival and there were big crowds there. Morgan Wade did two sold out shows at The Garage a few days ago and Kezia Gill has already sold out two of her tour dates in November so money is not the problem so you have to look at the line up for the festival.,2022-06-25 11:52,positive,sadness

I'd likely have gone, as I have before, but hadn't booked a ticket yet. Booked for next week's The 7 Hills Fest in the last couple of days.

I have plenty of live streams I missed in 2020 & 2021 when there was a plethora of live streams during lockdowns. I don't think I started watching you in the early days of the pandemic?  
When Megan Dixon Hood doesn't go live on a Friday I watch and share her live stream of the nearest date in 2020. This is for those who missed first time round & for those who still want their livestream ""fix"". 
I am at the moment watching a Cambree Lovesy 2020 stream.

Thank you for sharing these photos 
I saw you in the first Friday afternoon of pop up sets in 2016. I remember that to ""Meet & Greet"" the artists we had to queue away from the stage, which was a nuisance if one wanted to see the next artist. 
In later years we could meet the artist as soon as they left the stage. There was a 10 minute handover time between the sets",2023-03-20 20:09,positive,gratitude

As you can imagine as a singer all this adds up to quite a bit of voice trouble. So we made the decision to try and help the voice recover. With all the hours travelling, playing a gig, then hours travelling we thought the risk would be too great at this time. Especially after the doctor recommended vocal rest.",2023-04-14 12:24,positive,gratitude
