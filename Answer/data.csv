You'd have to be extremely gullible to not see that these people are all scammers, using false names, and someone elses' Facebook photos, and are hoping to con people out of their money by claiming they have spare tickets.  If you follow their links, you'll see that one person, who claims to have 4 spare tickets for London, appears to live in San Francisco.....or at least, that's where all ""their"" FB photos were taken.

So instead of going to the gig I ended up spending the evening in bed on painkillers with Lemsip. I was totally gutted. To cheer myself up, I just booked a trip to Ballymena for your Xmas show and suddenly I feel much better. :-)",2017-11-20 21:07
